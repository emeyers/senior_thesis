# Senior thesis rubric


Below is a rubric that shows what I would like to see in a senior project. It will also be used to help me come up with a final grade for the project based on how well each item on this list is done. 


## Weekly meetings (60% of grade)

A. Meeting consistently:
- Met each week. No more than 2 meetings were rescheduled/canceled by the student. 

B.	Made consistent progress: 
- Achieved weekly goals that were set out the prior week
  - Occasionally there will be a busy week where it will be hard to make progress, but this should less than a couple times over the semester. 
- Came up with solutions/alternative analyses for barriers that were encountered (rather than stopped working when a barrier was encountered).
- Prior to the midterm break, turned in an intial draft of Introduction/Background and analysis completed so far.

C.	Was prepared for the meetings:  
- Sent brief email update at least one day prior to each meeting listing:
  - What was achieved this week.
  - What barriers were encountered and how they tried to overcame these barriers
    - I can also help come up with solutions for barriers that are encountered during our meetings, but you should see if you can come up with solutions yourself.
  - What your plans/goals are for the following week
  - Any items you would like to discuss and get my feedback on
  - Anything else you would like me to know

D.	Engagement 
- Excited about the project (i.e., the meetings don’t feel like pulling teeth)
- Become involved in reading literature others have written on the topic (background research).
- Can come up with interesting/creative ideas to address questions of interest
  - i.e., explored a range of ideas, when one didn’t work pivoted to new idea
  - I can help brainstorm with you too during out meetings

  
## Written thesis (40% of grade)
 
A.	The thesis is well written: 
- Can clearly understand:
 - Why the project was undertaken. Clear motivation/reasons for undertaking this project in the intro section.
 - What was done (methods section)
 - What the results show (clear figures/analyses in the results section)
 - What the implications and limitations of this work are (conclusion section).
- Relevant citations are given throughout to backup any claims made,
- A good understanding of background/previous research is demonstrated. 

B.	Results: 
- Easy to understand what you did and each analysis was done.
- The results are believable and rigorous:
  - Results tested with multiple methods, separate datasets/cross-validation is used, etc.
  - Confounds are addressed, limitations are explored/listed
  - Did not just throw data into a large regression model and blindly trust the results.
- Results presented clearly:
  - Figures labeled, regression outputs clearly displayed, no key results missing.

C.	Scope: 
- Explored several different analyses to address the question of interest

D. Conclusions: 
- The conclusions discuss key findings, limitations of the work and possible future directions. 

E. Timeliness: 
- Thesis draft turned in by the appropriate deadline.
- Thesis draft is a 100% complete version of the thesis.
 - Once you send me your thesis draft, only smaller changes should be made based on the feedback I give you 

F. Reflection:
- Please fill out [this reflection survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCQDXCRGlYQ2dQYKNLIefO2huw1nCTG8zYbwBnlvcdZYygjQ/viewform) after you have completed your thesis so that I can learn how the profess when and how I can improve as an advisor in the future. 

G. GitHub repo
- Please put all code you used for your analyses on a GitHub repository (ideally as Quarto/Jupyter notebooks) so that your results are reproducible.

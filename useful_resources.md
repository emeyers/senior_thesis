# Useful resources

Below are some useful resources for completing your thesis:

### YCRC cluster

- If your project is computationally intensive, you should use the YCRC cluster which will make it much faster to run your analyses. [This repository wiki](https://github.com/emeyers/meyerslab/wiki/grace_cluster) describes how to use the YCRC cluster. 


### Citation manager

You should use a citation manager to collect references and to add citations to your thesis (rather than manually adding citations). I would recommend using [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) which has a plugin for your web browser that let's you easily import references into a bibliography. You can then also easily add these citations into a Word, LaTeX, or Google Doc.

# Getting started and meeting plans

The following document describes:
- What it will be like working with me on your senior thesis
- How to get started on your thesis
- Plans for the semester
- What you should aim to achieve over the semester


## Selecting a topic

The first thing you need to do to start on your thesis is to select a topic. I can help you with this process, but you should have some initial ideas of what you would like to do. Over the first couple of meetings we should try to get the goals of the project defined Apart from selecting the topic you should also try to:
-	Have a clear identifiable goal for the project
  -	You should define project in terms of achieving particular goals, and what success would like at the end of the semester rather than a vague statement
  -	It is ok to start with a somewhat vague statement like ‚ÄúI want to see how lineup effects influence run production‚Äù. But within the first 1-2 meetings should be more specific; e.g., ‚Äúwill look at x, y, z, and do a, b c, analyses‚Äù.
- You can add to these goals as you go (and potentially modify them), but should always be clear goals, and should always clearly justify changes;
  - e.g., it is ok if an analysis doesn‚Äôt work and to then try different analyses that might be more sucessful
 

## Weekly meetings

-	We will meet each week throughout the semester for ~30 minutes. 
-	In each each meeting you will:
  -	Review what you achieved in the week (particularly related to ‚Äúaction items‚Äù set out in previous meeting.
  -	Discuss any barriers you ran into, how you tried to overcome these barriers, and how I can help you.
  -	We will end each meeting discussing the action items that you will try to achieve for the following week.


## Preparing for the weekly meeting 

By at least the day before each weekly meeting, you should send me an email with the following information. Each answer should be ~3 sentences. 
- What you achieved in the current week
- How much time was spent working on the project, and how they would rate their progress (grade progress in the week: A, B, etc.).
- What roadblocks one is facing, questions they have, and how I can help them. 
- Thoughts about what to do for next week. 

We will discuss what was achieved and plans for next week during the meetings. 
Grades will be based on these reports in terms of evidence of progress made throughout the semester. 


## First things to do

-	Try to clearly define goals of the project; i.e., what success looks like. 
-	Try to figure out what the deliverables will be given at the end;
 -	e.g., 25 page paper in a Quarto document, with background on why the problem is interesting, background work in the areas, results and conclusions.
-	Create a GitHub repository where you can store all the content related to you thesis.
   - You should share this with me so that you can share results with me throughout the semester
   - You should put all your final code on this repo so that your work is reproducible
   - You should consister making this repo into a website that you can share with others (such are future employers, etc.) 


## Typical milestones

#### Weeks 1-2

Clearly define:
 - What questions you will address
 - What success looks like
 - What the end deliverable will be (success means you achieved end deliverable)
 - Start getting any data you need 

#### Weeks 2-3
- Get all data you need and clean it.
- Make sure the data is adequate to answer your questions of interest.
- Start on analyses to make sure the data is adaquate. 

#### Weeks 2-4
Write background section that discusses: 
- Why the problem is important/interesting
- Other work that has been done on the problem

### Weeks 5-8: 
- Analyze the data as discussed in your plan
- Modify plan as needed

#### Weeks 9-10: 
- Continue with follow up analyses based on your initial findings
- Write conclusions  

#### Weeks 10-13
- Finish writing the thesis
- Get feedback on the project and revise it as necessary.
- The goal should be to complete the project early so you can relax at the end üòä 



### Midterm draft

- You should send me an initial draft of their theses prior to the start of spring break.
- The draft should have the following sections:
-   Introduction with background
-   Methods section describing your analysis
-   Preliminary results.
I  will read your draft over spring break and give feedback. This is important so that  I can help make sure project is on the right track; e.g., make sure they understand the motivation behind way they are doing a particular project, catch any major confounds in the analyses, etc.


### How to get a good grade:

-	Attend weekly meeting. Occasionally you might need to cancel a weekly meeting, but really should only happen 1-2 times in the semester. Frequently cancelling meetings and/or not achieving goals on action items will result in poor grade. 
-	You should put in minimum of 5-8 hours a week on the project. Set a timer if necessary :)
-	Achieve action items each week
-	Have an interesting thesis with some clear results at the end!

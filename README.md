# S&DS senior thesis information

The repository contains information about doing a senior thesis with me. In particular, please see:

- [Getting started document](https://github.com/emeyers/senior_thesis-/blob/main/getting_started.md) which describes how to get started on the thesis what should be done over the course of the semester.

- [A rubric](https://github.com/emeyers/senior_thesis-/blob/main/rubric.md) which describes what a successful thesis consists of and how your grade will be determined.

- If your project is computationally intensive, you should use the YCRC cluster which will make it much faster to run your analyses. [This repository wiki](https://github.com/emeyers/meyerslab/wiki/grace_cluster) describes how to use the YCRC cluster.
